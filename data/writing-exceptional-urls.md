#Writing Exceptional URLs

Even in the age of AJAX and mobile apps, URLs still act as the building block of modern websites. Creating stronger URLs *probably* won't win you any awards or help you get the girl (guy), but they will make your site appear notably more professional and help provide cleaner analytics reports.

##Why This Matters

###Analytics

Even in modern analytics packages, URLs are the building blocks of the interaction model. Standard, persistent URL structures properly aggregate metrics and aid in building understandable reports.

###Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

To maximize value from a search engine results page (SERP), you need to (1) be present and (2) garner clicks.

Search engines qualify results based any number of attributes, but the most important is keyword coverage; using the same words and phrases as your customers. The more confident the search engine is a page is about the searcher’s query, the higher it ranks in the results. Matching keywords in the URL increases the search engine’s confidence in the page.

Getting users to click relies on visibility – being high on the page and differentiating the look of your result. SEs like Google bold matched keywords and users spend 24% of their time glancing at the URL [1]. It aids in confidence.

###User Experience

URLs are for people, not computers. [2]

We found that searchers are particularly interested in the URL when they are accessing the credibility of a destination. If the URL looks like garbage, less people are likely to click on that search hit. On the other hand, if the URL looks like the page will address the user’s question, they are more likely to click. [3]

Hierarchical URLs provide confidence that the user is in the correct area. It also provides hack-ability, allowing users to remove portions of the URL to gain access to a broader set of results like breadcrumbs.

###Social

Good URLs act as a UI – provide context about the link and understanding. consider email [3], twitter and facebook. Users look at URLs to determine if they want to click. Twitter truncates...

##Making a good URL.

###Keep them short

SEO – Users more likely to click on short URLs in search results according to marketing sherpa [4], Google weights the words in long titles a little less [5]

Social – Twitter only shows the domain and the next 15 characters

###Make them hackable

SEO – Search engines will take a URL and attempt to visit each “folder” in the structure

Ux – Users will cut off product name to see other, similar products.

Directories should end in /, pages do not need to end in anything [6]

###Make them mutable

You don’t want to change URLs frequently [7], if at all, but there will be time when a product name changes and you want the URL to reflect that.

A standard method of doing this is including a unique identifier in the URL name-of-page-ABC123.html

###Follow good canonicalization

 * Use dashes (instead of underscores) when replacing spaces or other non-alphanumeric characters.
 * URLs are case sensitive [8], so stick with a standard capitalization scheme. While any scheme will work, all lowercase is easier to type and generally looks nicer rendered as a string.

###Stay away from subdomains

Subdomains needlessly make the URL longer and cut into the available space to be used for keywords and product names.
