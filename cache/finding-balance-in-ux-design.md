# Finding Balance in UX Design

I won't vilify ad agencies, but the crux of [Peter Merholz's argument][1] seems much more global than the marketing viewpoint, and he hits on it briefly:

> Responsible user experience practice has to take a â€¦ balanced approach, trying to simultaneously serve both client and end-user, and look for those opportunities where their desires align.

If we could only practice UX at organizations with no business-need conflicts, the field wouldn't exist. Finding (and sometimes shifting) that balance is one of the most important things a user experience professional does.
