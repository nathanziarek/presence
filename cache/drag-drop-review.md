# Drag, Drop, Review

> If you are doing iPhone UI design, Review is the quickest way to judge your **mockups** on an actual device. Review will accurately display your mockups on both **Retina** and older displays.

[_Review_][1] itself is a great way to quickly review mockups directly on your iOS device, but it's the sweet magnifying loupe that makes this link worthy.
